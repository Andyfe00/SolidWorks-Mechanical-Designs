# SolidWorks-Mechanical-Designs

This repository contains three mechanical assemblies modeled in **SolidWorks**:  
a **Scissor Jack (Hydraulic Lift)**, a **Rocker-Bogie Rover** and the complete **mechanical and control design of an automatic palletizing system** that organizes and stacks heavy boxes onto pallets using **hydraulic and pneumatic actuators**. The systems were fully modeled in CAD and analyzed for mechanical performance, pneumatic/hydraulic sizing, and electrical integration. 
Each project includes all its individual parts, assemblies, and rendered previews.
